Leetcode Problem: Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurences of val in nums IN-PLACE. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

1) Return the len of nums.retain(|x| *x != val}}).


Things I learned from this problem.
1) I learned about the .retain() higher order function which is filter but acts in place instead of creating an iterator.
